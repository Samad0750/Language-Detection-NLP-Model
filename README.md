🚀 Mastering Language Detection: My Latest NLP Project!

I’m thrilled to share my latest project – Language Detection – where I built a powerful model to identify languages with high accuracy! 🌍💡

🔥 Project Highlights:

✅ Used the Multinomial Naïve Bayes Model, known for its efficiency in text classification.✅ Implemented three powerful text vectorization techniques:

Bag of Words (BoW) 🏷️

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) 📊

N-grams (capturing context through word sequences) 📖
✅ Achieved an impressive 95.7% accuracy with TF-IDF, proving its strength in text classification! 💯
✅ Designed the entire implementation in the most beginner-friendly way, making it easy for others to learn and apply. 🛠️

🌟 Why is Language Detection Important?

Language detection is crucial for various applications, including:
🔹 Social Media Monitoring 📢
🔹 Sentiment Analysis 💬
🔹 Machine Translation 🌎
🔹 Customer Support Automation 🤖

🏢 Companies Leading in This Domain:

Many top tech companies actively work on language processing and multilingual AI models, including:
🔹 Google (Google Translate, BERT, and NLP research)🔹 Microsoft (Azure Cognitive Services, Translator API)🔹 Meta (AI-powered translation tools and multilingual NLP)🔹 Amazon (AWS Comprehend for language analysis)🔹 OpenAI (Advanced NLP models like GPT)
